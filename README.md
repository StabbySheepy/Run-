# Run Away!!!
- A Survival Chase-Game : A ghost finds their way into a dangerous labryinthe that wants it double-dead

GamePlay and Mechanics: 
- Player uses WASD to move, and must survive against 3 enemies that follow and swarm the player for 10 seconds

Basic Requirements
- My game was made in Unity2D, is single player and takes only 10 seconds. It is compatible with keyboard, has a rules-screen, a win-screen and a lose-screen.
- My game meets all Audio Requirements: It has audio at all points in the game, with distinct sounds indicating a Win or Lose, player footsteps, and background
  music
- My game meets almost all Visual Requirements: I have custom sprites, character animations, backgrounds, animations and UI
- I failed to implement a particle system--while I tried to upload a custom sprite for my particles, I could not get it to function, so left it out.
  I acknowledge that I will lose points for this.
