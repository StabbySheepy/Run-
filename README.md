# Run Away!!!
- A Survival Chase-Game : A ghost finds their way into a dangerous labryinthe that wants it double-dead. They are chased by 3 silly TV-monsters, and must survive long enough to escape. 

GamePlay and Mechanics: 
- Player uses WASD to move, and must survive against 3 enemies that follow and swarm the player for 10 seconds. There are 3 enemies utilizing the A* PathTracking software in order to automatically track the player. 

Basic Requirements
- My game was made in Unity2D, is single player and takes only 10 seconds. It is compatible with keyboard, has a rules-screen, a win-screen and a lose-screen.
- My game meets all Audio Requirements: It has audio at all points in the game, with distinct sounds indicating a Win or Lose, player footsteps, and background
  music. I wanted to focus on a television-and-technology aesthetic, while also maintaining a horror atmosphere. I used a lot of tv-noises, as well as horror ambiance to achieve this. 
- My game meets almost all Visual Requirements: I have custom sprites, character animations, backgrounds, animations and UI. I added extra animations to give flair to my project, and to make up for the project requirements that I lack. I really wanted to focus on creating a cohesive artstyle that mimiced pixelated-games, and used Pac-Man as a major inspiration for this game.  
- I failed to implement a particle system--while I tried to upload a custom sprite for my particles, I could not get it to function, so left it out in order to reduce bugs and make the due date in time.
  I acknowledge that I will lose points for this ommission. I am not good at particles ;=;
